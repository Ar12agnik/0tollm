Perfect approach ðŸš€ Since youâ€™re learning **NumPy** as a foundation for **LLMs**, you donâ€™t need to know *everything* in NumPy, but you should master the core topics that directly help in ML/LLM math (tensors, linear algebra, broadcasting, etc.).

Hereâ€™s the list of **NumPy topics to master**:

* Basics

  * Array creation (`np.array`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.eye`)
  * Array attributes (`shape`, `ndim`, `dtype`, `size`)
  * Indexing and slicing (1D, 2D, nD arrays)
  * Boolean indexing and masking

* Array Operations

  * Vectorized operations (element-wise addition, multiplication, division, etc.)
  * Broadcasting rules
  * Aggregations (`sum`, `mean`, `max`, `min`, `std`, `var`, `argmax`, `argmin`)
  * Axis-wise operations

* Linear Algebra (essential for LLMs)

  * Dot product, inner product, outer product
  * Matrix multiplication (`@` and `np.dot`)
  * Transpose and reshaping (`reshape`, `ravel`, `flatten`)
  * Norms (`np.linalg.norm`)
  * Inverse, determinant, rank (`np.linalg.inv`, `np.linalg.det`, `np.linalg.matrix_rank`)
  * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (`np.linalg.eig`)
  * Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

* Advanced Array Manipulation

  * Stacking and splitting arrays (`vstack`, `hstack`, `split`)
  * Concatenation (`concatenate`)
  * Tiling and repeating (`tile`, `repeat`)
  * Broadcasting tricks

* Random Number Generation (`np.random`)

  * Uniform, normal distributions
  * Random integers
  * Shuffling and permutations
  * Seeding for reproducibility

* Useful Utilities

  * `np.where`, `np.unique`, `np.sort`, `np.argsort`
  * `np.clip`
  * `np.meshgrid` (very useful for understanding tensors)

These are the **essentials** that will directly map to ML math and later to **PyTorch/TensorFlow** tensor operations.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also give you the **math topics** (linear algebra + probability) you should study in parallel with NumPy for LLMs?
